## How To Play

You have 30 seconds to collect as much corn as you can before they disappear. Getting hit by an arrow costs you points, but you can use your abilities to avoid them. Either dash or use a temporary shield as needed. But choose wisely, only one can be used at a time, and there is a cooldown before you can use them again.

## Controls

Move: WASD

Dash: J

Shield: K
